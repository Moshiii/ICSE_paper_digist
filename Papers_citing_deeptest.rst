DeepXplore: Automated Whitebox Testing of Deep Learning Systems
Kexin et al 2017


white box testing

dataset:
including Udacity self-driving car challenge data, image data
from ImageNet and MNIST, Android malware data from
Drebin, and PDF malware data from Contagio/VirusTotal.

performance: 
The
inputs generated by DeepXplore achieved 34.4% and 33.2%
higher neuron coverage on average than the same number of
randomly picked inputs and adversarial inputs

Adversarial Sample Detection for Deep Neural Network through Model Mutation Testing
Jingyi  et al 2019 icse

   In this work, we provide a complementary perspective
and propose an approach for detecting adversarial samples at
runtime. The idea is that, given an arbitrary input sample to
a DNN, to decide at runtime whether it is likely to be an
adversarial sample or not. If it is, we raise an alarm and report
that the sample is ‘suspicious’ with certain confidence. Once
detected, it can be rejected or checked depending on different
applications.
