DeepXplore: Automated Whitebox Testing of Deep Learning Systems

white box testing

dataset:
including Udacity self-driving car challenge data, image data
from ImageNet and MNIST, Android malware data from
Drebin, and PDF malware data from Contagio/VirusTotal.

performance: 
The
inputs generated by DeepXplore achieved 34.4% and 33.2%
higher neuron coverage on average than the same number of
randomly picked inputs and adversarial inputs
